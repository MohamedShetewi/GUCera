# GUCera
GUCera is a database oriented project which represents a skeleton for a an online courses' website. There are 3 types of users: students, instructors and admins.
instructors could add new courses to the system which must be accepted by any of the admins before the students are able to enroll in. Instructors also can
define assignments for their courses and students can submit them and get grades in those assignments which contributes to their total grade in the course. More
features will be added soon.

MS-SQL is used for database management and the website is built using ASP.NET.
